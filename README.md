# Generating and cleaning a restricted context free grammar
For this second evidence we will analyze the Na’vi language and construct a context-free grammar to formally determine whether given words belong to the language

## Description
Na’vi is a constructed language created by Dr. Paul Frommer for Avatar, the 2009 film directed by James Cameron. The language has been growing and expanding due to continuous work by eager fans and the language creator. (Kelutral, n. d.).

Na’vi features a rich phonetic system, and a verb-subject-object (VSO) syntax, making it an excellent candidate for formal linguistic analysis.

### Structure of the Na'vi language

#### 1.- Syntax
Na’vi language follows a Verb-Subject-Object (VSO) word order. This means that in a typical sentence the verb comes first, followed by the subject and then the object. (Learn Na’vi, 2011)

>For example: 
>Lom tute ikran – Sees person banshee → “The person sees the banshee”

**Adjective Placement:** Adjectives can precede or follow nouns. 

When preceding, the adjective takes a suffix … a.
When following, it takes a prefix a … 

>For example:
>"ngima kilvan" and "kilvan angim" both mean "long river."

#### 2.- Morphology
Na’vi is an agglutinative language. This means that prefixes, infixes, and suffixes are attached to root words to convey grammatical relationships and meanings (Kelutral, n. d.).

Noun cases are marked with suffixes to indicate roles like subject, object, etc.
Verbs often contain infixes to show tense, aspect, mood, and speaker attitude (Kelutral, n. d.).

>For example:
>The verb root ‘taron’ (to hunt) might become ‘tìtaron’ (the act of hunting) or take infixes to show tense or aspect.

Na'vi language is highly modular and allows us to create or adapt a word for specific use based on the context. For example, all adjectives can be shifted into adverbs at any time, even if the resulting adverb may not listed in the dictionary. The created adverb may not always make sense, but the method remains (Kelutral, n. d.).

#### 2.- Grammatical Features
Na’vi uses grammatical cases to indicate the role a noun plays in the narrative of the sentence, which allows more flexibility in sentence structure (Learn Na’vi, 2011)

The order of Subject, Object and Verb is not constrained, allowing six core structures based on speaker preference.

>For example, for the sentence ‘I eat Fish’ we can express it like: 

>1.	oel payoangti yom
>2.	payoangti yom oel
>3.	yom oel payoangti
>4.	oel yom payoangti
>5.	payoangti oel yom
>6.	yom payoangti oel

>(Kelutral, n. d.)
